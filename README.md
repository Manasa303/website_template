# website_template

*Test Project*

Please complete the following test project. You will find the test site PSD located in the "psd" folder in the root directory. The file structure is very simple. All of our websites will follow a similar structure as presented in this test project. Please place the correct data into the correct file. 

For example:

-Everything above the "Princpal's Message" should be placed in the header.html file.
-Everything underneath the column area should go into the footer.

All of the fonts needed for this project are google fonts. You will be able to imbed the fonts using the google font API. 

Rules for making website: 

- Please do not change the file stuture or remove core markup that was added already.
- All text should remain text. 
- Please use classes for column sections. For example say I wanted to add a new section called "Upcoming Events2" the styling would carry over. 

Good luck and if you have any questions please feel to contact us.
